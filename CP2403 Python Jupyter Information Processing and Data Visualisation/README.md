# Statistical Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project was completed as part of my coursework at James Cook University, focusing on statistical data analysis using Python. The project includes multiple tasks, each demonstrating the application of different statistical techniques, such as ANOVA, Chi-Squared tests, Linear Regression, and Multiple Regression. These analyses were conducted to explore relationships within datasets and to draw meaningful conclusions based on statistical evidence.

## Goals
The objective of this project is to:
- **Perform Statistical Tests**: Apply statistical methods to analyze datasets and validate hypotheses.
- **Understand Relationships**: Investigate relationships between variables using techniques like regression analysis and chi-squared tests.
- **Derive Insights**: Interpret statistical results to make informed decisions and recommendations based on the data.

## Key Tasks

### 1. **Task 1: ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**
- **File**: `Ass-Part2-Task1-ANOVA - Kantapong Wongsanguan.ipynb`
- **Goal**: Perform a one-way ANOVA to test if there are significant differences between group means.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Import dataset and prepare data for analysis.
  - Conduct ANOVA to test the null hypothesis.
  - Interpret p-values and F-statistics to conclude whether group means are statistically different.

### 2. **Task 2: Chi-Squared Test**
- **File**: `Ass-Part2-Task2-Chi_Squared - Kantapong Wongsanguan.ipynb`
- **Goal**: Perform a chi-squared test to examine the association between two categorical variables.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Prepare contingency tables for the categorical data.
  - Perform the chi-squared test to assess independence between the variables.
  - Interpret chi-squared values and p-values to determine the relationship between the variables.

### 3. **Task 3: Linear Regression**
- **File**: `Ass-Part2-Task3-Linear_Regression- Kantapong Wongsanguan.ipynb`
- **Goal**: Use linear regression to model the relationship between a dependent variable and a single independent variable.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Load the dataset and perform exploratory data analysis.
  - Fit a linear regression model to predict the dependent variable.
  - Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics like R-squared, p-values, and residual analysis.

### 4. **Task 4: Multiple Regression**
- **File**: `Ass-Part2-Task4-Multiple_Regression-Kantapong Wongsanguan.ipynb`
- **Goal**: Perform multiple regression analysis to model the relationship between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Prepare the dataset for multiple regression.
  - Fit the multiple regression model and analyze the coefficients.
  - Assess model performance using R-squared, adjusted R-squared, and p-values.

### 5. **Part 1: Data Exploration and Preparation**
- **File**: `Assignment-Part1- KantapongWongsanguan.ipynb`
- **Goal**: Conduct an initial data exploration and preparation phase, which includes loading the data, handling missing values, and performing data visualization.
- **Key Steps**:
  - Load the dataset and perform initial data checks.
  - Visualize the data to identify trends, distributions, and potential issues.
  - Clean the dataset by handling missing values and preparing it for statistical analysis.

## Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python**: For data analysis and statistical modeling.
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations and mathematical computations.
  - `scipy.stats`: For performing statistical tests (ANOVA, Chi-Squared).
  - `statsmodels` and `sklearn`: For regression analysis and model evaluation.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization and exploring relationships between variables.

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-link>
    ```
2. Install the necessary Python libraries:
    ```bash

    ```
3. Open and run the Jupyter notebooks for each task:
    - `Assignment-Part1- KantapongWongsanguan.ipynb`
    - `Ass-Part2-Task1-ANOVA - Kantapong Wongsanguan.ipynb`
    - `Ass-Part2-Task2-Chi_Squared - Kantapong Wongsanguan.ipynb`
    - `Ass-Part2-Task3-Linear_Regression- Kantapong Wongsanguan.ipynb`
    - `Ass-Part2-Task4-Multiple_Regression-Kantapong Wongsanguan.ipynb`

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to apply key statistical techniques using Python. Each task showcases a specific method to analyze data and draw meaningful insights, helping inform decision-making based on data-driven evidence.
