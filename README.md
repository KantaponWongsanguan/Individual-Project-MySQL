# Layoff Analysis Project

## Project Overview
The Layoff Analysis Project focuses on examining a global layoffs dataset to uncover trends, patterns, and actionable insights that can guide strategic decision-making in workforce management. The project involves comprehensive data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using SQL and related tools.

## Goals
The objectives of this project are to:
- Clean and standardize a global layoffs dataset to ensure data accuracy and integrity.
- Perform exploratory data analysis to identify key trends, patterns, and outliers in the data.
- Provide data-driven recommendations to improve workforce management strategies and support decision-making processes.

## Specific KPIs / Key Project Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Remove duplicate records and handle missing values to maintain data integrity.
   - Standardize data formats, such as converting date fields from text to datetime and normalizing industry names.
   - Create a staging table to preserve raw data for reference while conducting transformations.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   - Analyze layoffs by company, industry, location, and time period to identify high-impact trends and patterns.
   - Calculate metrics such as the total number of layoffs, percentage laid off, and funds raised to assess the financial and operational impact.
   - Develop rolling sums and trend analyses to visualize changes in layoffs over time.

3. **Data Transformation:**
   - Optimize data storage and retrieval through data type conversion and standardization.
   - Transform the data to facilitate deeper analysis, such as segmenting by year, month, or industry.

4. **Visualization and Reporting:**
   - Create clear and concise visualizations to communicate findings, including dashboards and reports that highlight key insights.
   - Provide regular updates and ad hoc reports to stakeholders, such as HR and management teams.

## Recommendations / Insights
- **Trend Analysis:** Identified industries and locations most affected by layoffs, allowing for targeted workforce management strategies.
- **Timing of Layoffs:** Highlighted peak periods for layoffs, enabling proactive planning and resource allocation.
- **Data Quality Improvement:** Enhanced the datasetâ€™s reliability and accuracy, leading to more informed decision-making.
- **Strategic Insights:** Suggested areas for cost optimization and resource allocation based on identified patterns and trends.

## Technical Stack
- **SQL:** Used for data cleaning, data transformation, and performing complex queries to analyze and visualize data trends.
- **Excel:** Employed for initial data handling and developing basic visualizations and reports.
- **Data Warehousing:** Applied best practices in data storage and retrieval to optimize performance and maintain data integrity.
